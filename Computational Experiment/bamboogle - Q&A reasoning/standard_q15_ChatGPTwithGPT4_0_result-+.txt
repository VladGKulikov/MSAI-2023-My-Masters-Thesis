The fastest air-breathing manned aircraft is the NASA X-43, which holds the world record for the fastest speed achieved by an aircraft. It was developed by NASA, a United States government agency, with the help of various industry partners. So, the answer to the question "Who built the fastest air-breathing manned aircraft?" would be: NASA. However, it's worth noting that the X-43 is an unmanned experimental hypersonic aircraft. As of my last training cut-off in September 2021, the fastest air-breathing manned aircraft is the SR-71 Blackbird, built by Lockheed Martin's Skunk Works division.
