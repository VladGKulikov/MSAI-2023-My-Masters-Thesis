The father of the founder of modern human anatomy was Andreas Vesalius.

Vesalius was born in Brussels in 1514 and is considered the father of modern human anatomy for his groundbreaking work, "De Humani Corporis Fabrica" ("On the Structure of the Human Body"). He was the son of a successful physician and apothecary, and he followed in his father's footsteps, studying medicine and anatomy at the University of Paris and later at the University of Padua in Italy.

It was at Padua that Vesalius published his masterpiece, "De Humani Corporis Fabrica," which was revolutionary for its time. He was the first to use human cadavers for dissection and accurately depict the human body in anatomical illustrations. His work was the first to correct many of the errors and misconceptions that had been accepted as fact for centuries, and it became the standard text for medical students for the next two centuries.

In addition to his work in anatomy, Vesalius was also a skilled surgeon and physician, and he made important contributions to the understanding of blood circulation and the nervous system. He died in 1564 at the age of 50, while on a voyage to the Holy Land.
